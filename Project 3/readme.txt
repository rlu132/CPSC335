Project 3:

Both algorithms are contained within main.py and the program will compare both the exhaustive and dynamic approach with the same randomly generated fields. Currently, the seed is set to 0 in order to create reproducable results. Unless modified, the program will create 20 test cases with varying numbers of rows and columns before outputting the example field given in project instructions.

Type 'python3 main.py' to execute the program.

**NOTE: Results shown in the report use modified parameters (increased test cases, rows, and columns). The program in this version has been scaled down in order to limit runtime.
